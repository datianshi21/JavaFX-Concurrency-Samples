This project is set up to show concurrency examples using JavaFX. The user interface is fairly crude for now until we get time to tidy up the interface.

To get the project working you will need to

1. Open in NetBeans

2. Change the Resource to use your own Java environment that you have created in NetBeans that has a JavaFX component to it. How to do this can be located here: http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/javafx-setup.html
